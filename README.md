1. About Me
I am a detail-oriented graduate in Geospatial Engineering with a strong focus on machine learning and AI model development. My passion lies in applying AI to solve challenges in sustainability and climate intelligence. I specialize in processing large datasets, building predictive models, and developing end-to-end ML workflows using tools like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Google Earth Engine.



2. Featured Projects
Project A: AI-Powered Urban Heat Island (UHI) Model

A machine learning pipeline designed for environmental modeling and temperature prediction. 




Objective: To analyze 10 years of Landsat data to predict temperature variations and urban heat patterns.

Methodology:

Built a full ML pipeline using Python and Google Earth Engine (GEE).



Implemented a Random Forest model for robust temperature prediction.



Automated preprocessing and feature engineering to handle large-scale satellite data.

Results:

Produced visual dashboards and spatial insights for climate analysis.

Evaluated model performance using RMSE, cross-validation, and feature analysis.


Tech Stack: Python, GEE, Random Forest, Scikit-learn.



Project B: Space-borne AI Project (STAR.VISION)

Optimizing satellite imagery classification through automated workflows. 




Objective: To improve the efficiency of image classification for space-borne data.


Methodology:

Conducted data labeling, cleaning, and preprocessing on satellite imagery.


Implemented classification models using Python.

Created comprehensive model documentation and evaluation reports.

Results:

Deployed an automated ML classification workflow that improved efficiency by 40%.



Tech Stack: Python, Automated Workflows, Classification Models.




Project C: R Spatial Programming & Tutoring

Educational initiative focused on spatial statistics and raster processing. 




Role: University Spatial Hub Tutor.



Activities: Taught R programming for spatial statistics and guided students through raster processing and visualization techniques.
